You will find here, all requested files to buid the ouah! project
1) Publication with detailed instructions to build the project.
  YOU MUST READ IT before going futher
  The OUAH! board contains an integrated power supply powered by 220 v.
    Precautions for use are therefore necessary to avoid any electrocution.
    Please, see the recommendations made in this publication.
    It is the responsibility of readers wishing to carry out the Ouah! to take all the necessary precautions,
     the author can in no way be held responsible for the consequences of an electric shock.
3) Files to build the DCF77 clock :
- Kicad files including schematic and printed circuit board
- VHDL sources and and bin file to be uploaded to the Upduino board
3) Files to build the DCF77 simulator
